5. Add basic appeals and dispute resolution processes

**Success Metrics:**
- Evaluation process completion time: Target 50% reduction
- Evaluation consistency score: Target 90%+ standardization
- Vendor satisfaction with evaluation process: Target 85%+
- Legal challenges to evaluation decisions: Target 70% reduction
- Audit compliance score: Target 95%+

This roadmap provides a clear path to transform the basic evaluation system into a world-class, transparent, and efficient tender evaluation platform.
